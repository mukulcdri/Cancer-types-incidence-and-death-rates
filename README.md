# Cancer-types-incidence-and-death-rates

Cancer incidence and death rate among different races:

Executive Summary:

This project is related to cancer epidemiology where I want to see the impact of different cancers on different races for over last 15 years (2009 - 2014). I am also interested to see whether all the cancers are same or some are more prevalent than others. I also want to touch upon the cancer incidence and mortality rate in different races to further investigate the reason behind that if there is any difference. Over all this project will give us a comprehensive view of the cancer prevalence and the impact of research and developement on the incidence and death rate.

Motivation:

Being a Biomedical scientist, I have worked extensively on Breast cancer and colorectal cancer (colon cancer). I understand the importance of research in diagnostics and new drug target identification for these deadly diseases. Despite hard work of many scientists for so many years, general public awareness about the progress made in this field is meagre. My project will show how cancer incidence and mortality rate has changed over last 15 years in different races and gender. 

Data Question:

Whether there is a change in cancer incidence and mortality rate from 1999 - 2014 and which cancer and race is mostly affected with this deadly disease?

Data Sources:

Data from CDC.
